      <h5>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h5>
      <p>My strengths include an eye for detail, perseverance, single-mindedness, and consensus-building.</p>
      <p>My weaknesses include overthinking trivial issues, variable attention spans, and a history of preferring not to verbally communicate.</p>
      <h5>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h5>
      <p>I try not to spend too much or too little time on tasks big and small.
        Never be afraid to seek the advice and opinions of others, no matter how smart or confident one can be.
        At the same time, "design by committee" is to be avoided.</p>
      <h5>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h5>
      <p>Whenever I get bogged down with a certain issue, I seek advice on Slack #Foundations from facilitators and fellow students.
        I also refer to other online resources such as <a href=https://www.w3schools.com>W3Schools</a>.
      </p>
      <h5>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h5>
      <p>What I expect from the facilitation team is specific coding advice,
        while at the same time I try not to occupy too much of their own time.</p>
      <h5>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h5>
      <p>I still worked part-time in the mornings until the boot camp segment started, at which point I resigned from my job for good.</p>
