            <h5>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h5>
            <p>HTML is like a builder who has the tools and materials to put a house together.
                CSS can be thought of as an architect who designs the house, and/or an interior designer who determines the colour schemes.</p>
            <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h5>
            <p>A control flow is the sequence in which the code is read through.</p>
            <p>Loops tell a code segment to repeat a command until a specific point is reached.</p>
            <p>To the layperson, control flow and loops can be described as follows:
                Taking the analogy of the builder and architect mentioned above, a high-rise apartment is to be built to the architect's plan.
                It has the same layout for each floor, with the exception of the ground floor and penthouse.
                The builder then constructs each floor until the building tops out.
            </p>
            <h5>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h5>
            <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a standardised coding interface that categorises HTML and XML pages into tree structures and nodes
                It allows for rapid access and modification with languages such as JavaScript, by way of developer tools including Visual Studio Code.</p>
            <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
            <p>An array stores multiple data values within a single variable. An object builds on arrays by allowing different properties.</p>
            <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
            <p>Functions take one or more values as input, and return a calculated result. They are useful when code has to be frequently reused.</p>
