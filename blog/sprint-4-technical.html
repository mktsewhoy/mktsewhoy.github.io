        <h1>Sprint 4 Technical</h1>

        <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>

        <div class=pbox>
            <h3>Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>

            <h5>What was the problem?</h5>
            <p>I was trying to fix problems involving arrays and objects in the Gradebook kata, where the syntax seemed picky on the surface.</p>
            <h5>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h5>
            <p>I used pseudocode and frequent commenting in an attempt to map out what each part did and to better understand the structure,
                and Console.logging to visualise if the output went as planned.
                I also kept referring to online code resources like FreeCodeCamp and Mozilla Developer to check for correct syntax.</p>
            <h5>How did you feel throughout the process?</h5>
            <p>It was often irritating, and I kept over-thinking many of the problems.
                But once each segment was solved, I knew I could eventually get there.</p>
            <h5>What did you learn?</h5>
            <p>With apologies to the architect <a href=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe>Mies van der Rohe</a>, less can usually be more.</p>
            
            <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>

            <h5>What was the problem?</h5>
            <p>Writing JavaScript syntax in JavaScript Variables and Object Types.</p>
            <h5>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h5>
            <p>Going by only the error messages generated (Reading Error Messaging),
                I kept adding and amending each piece of the necessary code (Trying Something) until the conditions were satisfied.</p>
            <h5>How did you feel throughout the process?</h5>
            <p>It felt like a process of elimination, which meshed in well with my sense of logic.</p>
            <h5>What did you learn?</h5>
            <p>That doing is everything.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>

        <div class=pbox>
            <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
                <p>Very useful when I have to divide-and-rule a problem, or showing myself and others how things work.</p>
            <h5>Trying something</h5>
                <p>There's often no substitute for building prototypes and doing dry runs.</p>
            <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
                <p>Something to be worked on, as pseudocoding fills much of this role for me right now.</p>
            <h5>Reading error messages</h5>
                <p>An important part of the learning process and eliminating problems.</p>
            <h5>Console.logging</h5>
                <p>Very much so, when I have to check the output is working.</p>
            <h5>Googling</h5>
                <p>I commonly do this for specific code functions and commands. FreeCodeCamp also helps.</p>
            <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
                <p>I resort to this when all else fails.</p>
            <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
                <p>As with asking for peers, but when I need a private discussion.</p>
            <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
                <p>Feels like a box-ticking process at first, but ultimately provides a sense of direction.</p>
