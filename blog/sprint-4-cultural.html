        <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <div class=pbox>
            <h5>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h5>
                <p>To the layperson, neuroplasticity can be thought of as keeping the brain engaged with new things to learn so it can adapt and stay sharp.
                It also aids in resilience and "self-repairing" in the event of brain injury or disease.
                </p>
            <h5>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h5>
                <p>Being neuro-diverse, it's a positive development for those who don't exactly fit the traditional rote-learning model.
                In addition, I'm older than the average Dev Academy student, so the old adage, "it's never too late to learn", comes to mind.
                </p>
            <h5>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meditation, regular breaks and other forms of relaxation, so that things don't feel as much of a drag.</li>
                    <li>Continually reading and learning new things.</li>
                    <li>Sleeping well.</li>
                    <li>Having a plan or goal.</li>
                    <li>Engaging in creative activities.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
        <div class=pbox>
            <h5>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h5>
                <p>The Growth Mindset focuses on the "not yet" and "doing" instead of the "what now?" and "being". It provides people with something to work towards,
                instead of being stuck in the present or past.</p>
            <h5>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h5>
                <p>Not much surprised me, but I now agree on having a proper roadmap and destination, and the need for lifelong learning.</p>
            <h5>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h5>
                <p>I will try to remember that piece by piece does the trick, and that Rome wasn't built in a day.</p>
