        <h1>EQ (Emotional Intelligence)</h1>
        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <div class=pbox>
            <p>Emotional Intelligence, or Emotional Quotient (EQ), is a measurement of an individual's ability to manage their own emotions around other people,
                such as empathy, teamwork, adaptability, and self-control.
            </p>
            </div>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
            <div class=pbox>
                <p>EQ differs from IQ in a number of aspects. To name a few examples:</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class=ptable>
                <p>EQ is typically learned and built upon.</p><p>IQ is innate.</p>
                <p>EQ is measured by personality questionnaires.</p><p>IQ is measured by standardised logical tests.</p>
                <p>EQ measures one's ability to positively interact with others.</p><p>IQ measures one's ability to process information and carry out tasks.</p>
                <p>EQ determines life outcomes.</p><p>IQ determines academic outcomes.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
                
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <div class=pbox>
                <p>EQ is important because in many ways it &mdash; or the lack of &mdash; can determine not just how well a person interacts with others,
                    but also their overall quality of life.
                    On an organisational level, it can greatly affect the overall morale within organisations.
                    Low EQ has been attributed to workplace bullying, over-zealous perfectionism, low productivity, and impulsive decision-making,
                    among other negative outcomes.</p>
