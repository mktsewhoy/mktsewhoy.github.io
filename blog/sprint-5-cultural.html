            <h5>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Try not to over-think a seemingly minor problem where possible.</li>
                <li>Everyone is here to help out each other when encountering difficulty, and to understand one another's traits.</li>
                <li>Piece by piece often does the trick.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
            <p>The importance of being in the right frame of mind.</p>
            <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
            <p>Sticking to the recommended scheules was a challenge at times, for someone who's accustomed to making things up as they go along.
                Also, putting thoughts to (digital) paper as a naturally self-effacing type took some getting used to.</p>
            <h5>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h5>
            <p>Because soft skills are a major part of being a web developer and the wider ICT sector.</p>
            <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?
            Justify your answer.</h5>
            <p>Not necessarily. It's one thing to be a coding expert, but it's quite another to make it as one in isolation.
                Technical skills alone don't cut it as much as they used to,
                as a rapidly-changing ICT industry increasingly requires wider skill sets.</p>
