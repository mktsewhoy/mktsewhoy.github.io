        <h2>Core personal values</h2>
        <div class=pbox>
            <h5>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
                Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h5>
            <p>I've worked in the same job for over a decade, in an industry that's facing pressure on multiple fronts &mdash;
            namely online retailers like Amazon and Mighty Ape on one front, big box retailers such as JB Hifi on another,
            and changes in technology including tablets and smartphones on yet another front.
            Despite building up a loyal customer base over the years, eventually I felt that it would be better for me to take the plunge,
            rather than risk getting pushed out by external forces.</p>
            <p>Having discussed what to do next with friends and family,
                I came to realise that web development was one major way forward that could utilise my existing skill sets and personal values,
                while still being relatively future-proofed.
                In the case of Dev Academy, it offered a vocational-style approach that I
                felt I was better suited to than the previous university study in ICT I engaged in some years back,
                which didn't quite work out as planned.
            </p>

            <h5>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h5>
            <p>I have long had a fascination with details, ever since I started typing on my first ever computer at junior school age.
                I've also faced the old-fashioned Asian parental pressure to succeed,
                which experts now conclude can end up counter-productive in excessive doses.
                In spite of such pressures, I've still come out of it in one piece. As the old adage goes, "never say die".
                My various life experiences throughout school, tertiary education and work have also taught me the importance of collaboration and altruism.
            </p>

        <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
        <div class=pbox>
            <h5>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h5>
            <p>As mentioned above, a fascination with details is by far one of my biggest strengths.
                As for limitations, I've long been the kind of person who prefers to keep their head down.
                I've had to informally learn much about verbal and personal communication in my current job,
                which has involved considerable face-to-face interaction with clients.
                And with Dev Academy, it pays to communicate early and often, and not just for a smoother learning process.
            </p>

            <h5>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h5>
            <p>Being fascinated with details can be a double-edged sword.
                On the one hand, it's good for testing and weeding out bugs;
                on the other hand it can lead to getting bogged down on seemingly trivial issues.
            </p>

            <h5>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others,
                but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were,
                and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h5>
            <p>In my current job, I have had to frequently balance the rights of customers and maximising business turnover,
                in a mature market segment.
                I have usually tried to minimise the possibility of major conflicts happening in the first place.
                But where conflict is unavoidable with particularly tricky situations, such as complex repairs that cost more than estimated,
                there's no choice but to keep every party posted as to what's going on and why.
                On top of that, rapid turnaround of jobs to retain customer loyalty is another way to stand out from much larger competition.
